# TvSorter V2 PRD

## Overview

TvSorter is a LAN-only web application intended to run inside a privileged LXC container.
It helps curate TV shows, anime, and films from mounted input folders into clean,
Plex/Jellyfin-friendly output libraries without modifying the original files.

V2 reimplements the original Python/FastAPI app with a Rust backend and a TypeScript/React
frontend while preserving the product behavior.

The app lets a user browse mounted input folders, select files or folders, identify the
show and episode from public metadata sources, manually correct matches when needed, then
hardlink or copy the selected media into a curated output folder using a consistent naming
structure.

## Goals

- Provide a web UI for manually controlled TV/anime/film imports.
- Keep source files untouched.
- Allow per-import choice between hardlink and copy.
- Support separate manually configured output roots for TV, Anime, and Film.
- Persist imported library state across app restarts.
- Allow users to see already imported files from the output folders.
- Use non-login public metadata APIs.
- Use English metadata.
- Support normal season/episode naming for anime and TV.
- Ignore subtitles for the MVP.

## Non-Goals

- No automatic deletion, moving, or renaming of source files.
- No user login or authentication in the MVP.
- No subtitle import in the MVP.
- No automatic daemon-style watch/import workflow in the MVP.
- No dependency on paid or logged-in metadata APIs in the MVP.

## Runtime Environment

- Runs inside a privileged LXC container.
- Input and output folders are mounted into the LXC by the host.
- The web app is available only on the LAN.
- The app process should run as a non-root user where possible.
- Existing host media permissions should not be changed by TvSorter; the LXC service identity
  should be matched to the existing writable UID/GID or group when mounts are shared.
- Hardlinks only work when source and destination are on the same filesystem/device. If
  hardlinking fails, the UI must explain the failure and let the user copy instead.

## Stack

- **Backend:** Rust, axum (HTTP) + tokio (async runtime).
- **Database:** SQLite via rusqlite (single connection behind a mutex; short synchronous critical sections).
- **Metadata HTTP:** reqwest (rustls TLS).
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript, built with Vite, embedded into the binary via rust-embed.
- **Media inspection:** ffprobe (ffmpeg) for the resolution-based quality fallback.
- **Service management:** systemd inside the LXC. Built from source (Rust + Node) on install/update.

## Metadata Providers

- **TV:** TVMaze public API (no key). Show search and episode list.
- **Anime:** Jikan public API (no key, MyAnimeList data). Requests throttled to avoid 429s.
- **Film:** IMDb-style public suggestion endpoint first, Wikidata as a fallback (descriptive user agent).

Provider calls are cached in SQLite and de-duplicated during batch matching. A repeated show
reuses one search and one episode-list lookup. If a provider rate-limits or fails, the
filename-parsed fallback remains available for manual correction.

Future optional providers (require keys): TMDB, TheTVDB, AniList.

## User Configuration

The Settings UI configures: one or more input roots, one TV output root, one Anime output
root, one Film output root, and a copy speed limit (Mo/s, default 15). It shows read/write
permission checks for configured roots and provides a server-side folder picker.

## Import Workflow

1. Open the web UI.
2. Select an input root and browse folders.
3. Select one or more files or folders (folders expand recursively into video files).
4. Choose media type: TV, Anime, or Film.
5. The app parses each filename for show title, year, season, episode, and quality, and runs
   the matching provider lookup (TVMaze / Jikan / IMDb+Wikidata). When the filename has no
   quality tag, ffprobe fills it from the video resolution.
6. The app shows proposed matches; the user may override any field, re-search providers and
   apply a result to one or all rows, or load the provider episode list and pick an episode.
7. The app previews destination paths.
8. The user chooses hardlink, copy, or test, and a conflict policy.
9. The app performs the import as a background job with progress and cancellation, then records
   it in SQLite and shows it in Library/History.

If a running import is cancelled, TvSorter stops the current copy, removes any partial
destination file, aborts remaining queued items, and keeps already completed imports recorded.

## Naming Format

TV and Anime (separate output roots, same structure):

```text
Show Name (Year)/Season XX/Show Name (Year) - SXXEYY - Episode Name - Quality.ext
```

Film files are written directly under the Film output root:

```text
Film Name (Year) - Quality.ext
```

## Quality Detection

1. Filename tags such as `720p`, `1080p`, or `2160p`.
2. ffprobe resolution fallback (maps stream height to the nearest tier).
3. `Unknown` when quality cannot be determined.

## Import Actions & Conflict Handling

Actions: `hardlink`, `copy`, `test` (preview-only). Source files are never modified.

Conflict modes when the destination exists: `skip` (default), `replace`, `index` (keep both with
a `(2)` suffix), `fail`.

## Persistence

SQLite stores settings, input roots, import history, library state, provider cache, and manual
source status overrides. Each import records source path/size/mtime/device/inode, output path,
media type, provider and show ID, show title/year, season/episode/episode title, quality, action,
conflict policy, result, and timestamp. An output rescan reconciles files added/removed outside
the app.

## Web UI Pages

- **Settings:** input/output roots, copy speed limit, folder picker, permission checks.
- **Browse:** input-root navigation, human-readable sizes (e.g. `1,34 Go`), multi-select,
  recursive folder expansion, sticky controls, per-source status badges and filter, manual
  status overrides, clickable rows, dark theme toggle.
- **Match Queue:** parsed data, provider candidates, manual correction, re-search with
  apply-to-row/all, episode dropdown, quality correction, wrapped long paths.
- **Import Preview:** source, destination, action, conflict status.
- **Import Results:** per-item state with color coding and a state filter; permission failures
  show actionable output-mount guidance.
- **Long Operations:** indeterminate indicator after 2s; determinate background import progress
  with current filename, item counts, byte-level copy progress, and percentage; copy throttling
  per the configured speed limit.
- **Library:** imported files grouped by type, present/missing indicator, output rescan.
- **History/Logs:** completed, skipped, and failed imports with error messages.

## API Surface

`GET /health`, `GET/PUT /api/settings`, `GET /api/browse`, `POST /api/match`, `POST /api/preview`,
`POST /api/import-jobs`, `GET /api/import-jobs/:id`, `POST /api/import-jobs/:id/cancel`,
`GET /api/import-jobs/:id/results`, `GET /api/library`, `POST /api/library/rescan`,
`GET /api/history`, `GET /api/search`, `GET /api/episodes`, `POST /api/source-status`,
`GET /api/folders`. All non-API routes serve the embedded SPA (client-side routing fallback).

## Safety Requirements

- All file browsing is constrained to configured input roots; path traversal is prevented.
- Output writes are constrained to configured TV/Anime/Film output roots.
- Source files are never mutated.
- Existing output files are never overwritten without an explicit user conflict choice.
- Hardlink failures never silently fall back to copy.

Borrows concepts from FileBot (action selection, conflict modes, query override, preview/test)
and mnamer (parsing, provider abstraction, configurable formats, no-overwrite behavior, cache/test).
